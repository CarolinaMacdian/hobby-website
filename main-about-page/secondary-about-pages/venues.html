      Salsa dance socials are commonly held in night clubs, bars, ballrooms,
      restaurants, and outside, especially if part of an outdoor festival. Salsa
      dancing is an international dance that can be found in most metropolitan
      cities in the world. Festivals are held annually, often called a Salsa
      Congress, in various host cities aimed to attract a variety of salsa
      dancers from other cities and countries. The events bring dancers together
      to share their passion for the dance, build community, and share moves and
      tips. These events usually include salsa dance performers, live salsa
      music, workshops, open dancing, and contests.
