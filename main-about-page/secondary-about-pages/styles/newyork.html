        "On 2" style salsa originated in New York and is often referred to as
        New York style. It is a linear form of salsa, where dancers dance in a
        slot, similar to LA style salsa. Unlike other styles of salsa, however,
        New York style is danced on the second beat of the music ("on 2"), and
        the follower, not the leader, steps forward on the first measure of the
        music. There is also often a greater emphasis on performing "shines" in
        which dancers separate themselves and dance solo with intricate footwork
        and stylingâ€” a phenomenon that likely has origins from Swing and New
        York Tap.

        One of the most influential figures in New York style salsa is Eddie
        Torres (known as "the Mambo King"), who is credited with helping to
        formalize the on 2 salsa timing (based on mambo) and helping to
        popularize it by teaching it in dance studios in New York and through
        early instructional tapes.

        New York style salsa emphasizes harmony with the percussive instruments
        in salsa music, such as the congas, timbales, and clave, since many or
        all of those instruments often mark the second beat in the music.
