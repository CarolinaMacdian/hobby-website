      <p>
        Cali-Style Salsa, also known as Colombian Salsa and Salsa Cale√±a, is
        based around the Colombian City of Cali. Cali is also known as the
        "Capital de la Salsa" (Salsa's Capital); due to salsa music being the
        main genre in parties, nightclubs and festivals in the 21st century.

        The elements of Cali-Style Salsa were strongly influenced by dances to
        Caribbean rhythms which preceded salsa, such as Pachanga and Boogaloo.
        Cali has the highest number of salsa schools and salsa teams in the
        world. Many of the competitions are held in Colombia

        The central feature is the footwork which has quick rapid steps and
        skipping motions called "repique". Colombian style may execute
        Cross-body Leads or the "Dile Que No" as seen in other styles, but would
        rather step in place and displace in closed position. They include
        various acrobats such as partnered flips to entertain with these jaw
        dropping stunts. Their footwork is intricate and precise, helping
        several Colombian Style dancers win major world championships. Cali
        hosts many annual salsa events such as the World Salsa Cali Festival and
        the Encuentro de Melomanos y Coleccionistas.
