      <p>
        In the 1950s, Salsa Rueda or more accurately Rueda de Casino was
        developed in Havana, Cuba. Pairs of dancers form a circle ("Rueda" in
        Spanish means "Wheel"), with dance moves called out by one person. Many
        of the moves involve rapidly swapping partners.

        "Rueda de Cuba" is original type of Rueda, originating from Cuba. It is
        not as formal as Rueda de Miami and consists of about 30 calls. It was
        codified in the 1970s.

        "Rueda de Miami" originated in the 1980s from Miami, is a formal style
        with many rules based on a mix, and is a hybridization of Rueda de Cuba
        & North American dance styles, with some routines reflecting American
        culture (e.g. Coca-Cola, Dedo, Adios) which is not found in the
        traditional Cuban-style Rueda.
