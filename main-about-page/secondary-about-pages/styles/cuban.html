      <p>
        In Cuba, a popular dance known as Casino was marketed as Cuban-style
        salsa or Salsa Cubana abroad to distinguish it from other salsa styles
        when the name was popularized internationally in the 1970s. Dancing
        Casino is an expression of popular social culture; Cubans consider
        casino as part of social and cultural activities centering on their
        popular music. The name Casino is derived from the Spanish term for the
        dance halls, "Casinos Deportivos" where much social dancing was done
        among the better-off, white Cubans during the mid-20th century and
        onward.

        Historically, Casino traces its origin as a partner dance from Cuban
        Son, Cha Cha Cha, Danzón and Guaracha. Traditionally, Casino is danced
        "a contratiempo". This means that, distinct from subsequent forms of
        salsa, no step is taken on the first and fifth beats in each clave
        pattern and the fourth and eighth beat are emphasized. In this way,
        rather than following a beat, the dancers themselves contribute in their
        movement, to the polyrhythmic pattern of the music. At the same time, it
        is often danced "a tiempo", although both "on3" (originally) and "on1"
        (nowadays).

        What distinguishes this style is the understanding and spontaneous use
        of Afro-Cuban dance vocabulary within a "Casino" dance. In the same way
        that a "sonero" (lead singer in Son and salsa bands) will "quote" other,
        older songs in their own, a "casino" dancer will frequently improvise
        references to other dances, integrating movements, gestures and extended
        passages from folk dances. This is particularly true of African
        descended Cubans. Such improvisations might include extracts of rumba,
        dances for African deities, the older popular dances such as Cha Cha Chá
        and Danzon as well as anything the dancer may feel.
