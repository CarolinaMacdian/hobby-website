      <p>
        Los Angeles style salsa (LA style) is danced "on 1" where dancers break
        forward on the first beat of the music, in contrast to New York style
        which is danced on 2. LA style salsa is danced in a line or "slot" with
        dancers exchanging positions throughout the dance, unlike Cuban salsa
        which is danced in a more circular fashion.

        The two essential elements of this dance are the forward–backward basic
        step and the cross-body lead. In this pattern, the leader steps forward
        on 1, steps to the right on 2-3 while turning 90 degrees
        counter-clockwise (facing to the left), leaving the slot open. The
        follower then steps straight forward on 5-6 and turns on 7-8, while the
        leader makes another 90 degrees counter-clockwise and slightly forward,
        coming back into the slot. In total, the couple turned 180° with the
        follower and leader switching places.

        The "Vazquez Brothers" (Luis Vazquez, Francisco Vazquez, and Johnny
        Vazquez) are credited for the early development and growth of LA Style.
        Luiz Vazquez was the co-founder of Los Angeles's first salsa dance team,
        Salsa Brava. The Vazquez Brothers drew influence from stage dances such
        as tap dance and helped develop LA style's reputation for flashy moves
        and acrobatics.

        Other prominent figures in LA style salsa include salsa promoter Albert
        Torres, who created the LA Salsa Congress, the first salsa congress in
        the United States and for many years one of the largest salsa events in
        the world. Later dancers such as Alex Da Silva, Christian Oviedo, and
        Liz Lira are also credited with developing the LA style of dancing as we
        know it today.
