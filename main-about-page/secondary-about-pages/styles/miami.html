      <p>
        Developed by Cuban immigrants to Florida and centered on Miami, this
        dance style is a fusion of Casino and elements from American culture and
        dances. The major difference that distinguishes the Miami-style from
        other North American styles is the "Atras" or "Diagonal", back breaking
        steps performed backwards diagonally instead of moving forwards and
        backwards as seen in the New York style. Dancers do not shift their body
        weight greatly as seen in other styles. Instead, dancers keep their
        upper body still, poised and relaxed, focusing on foot movement. The
        dancer breaks mostly On1.

        A major difference between Cali Style and Miami-style is the latter is
        exclusively danced on the downbeat (On1) and has elements of shines and
        show-style added to it, following repertoires of North American styles.
        Miami-style has many adherents, particularly Cuban-Americans and other
        Latinos based in South Florida.
