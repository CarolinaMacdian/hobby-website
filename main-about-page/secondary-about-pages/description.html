        Salsa is a partnered dance where the lead takes the follower through a
        series of spins and turn patterns to music. Salsa's tempo ranges from
        about 150bpm (beats per minute) to around 250bpm, although most dancing
        is done to music somewhere between 160 and 220bpm. The basic Salsa dance
        rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music.
        Salsa dancers can also break apart to dance solo, known as "shines". The
        two main styles of salsa are linear and circular. In linear salsa,
        dancers remain in their "slot", switching places from one side of the
        slot to the other, similar to West Coast Swing â€” New York-style salsa
        and LA-style salsa are both danced this way. The second salsa style is
        circular salsa. Here, dancers circle around each other, reminiscent of
        East Coast Swing. Both Cuban and Colombian salsa follow this circular
        pattern. Incorporating other dance styling techniques into salsa dancing
        has become very common for both men and women: shimmies, leg work, arm
        work, body movement, spins, body isolations, shoulder shimmies, rolls,
        even hand styling, acrobatics, and lifts.
