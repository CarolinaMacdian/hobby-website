        Salsa generally uses music suitable for dancing ranges from about 150
        bpm (beats per minute) to around 250 bpm, although most dancing is done
        to music somewhere between 160 and 220 bpm.

        The key instrument that provides the core groove of a salsa song is the
        clave. It is often played with two wooden sticks (called clave) that are
        hit together. Every instrument in a salsa band is either playing with
        the clave (generally: congas, timbales, piano, tres guitar, bongos,
        claves (instrument), strings) or playing independent of the clave rhythm
        (generally: bass, maracas, g√ºiro, cowbell). Melodic components of the
        music and dancers can choose to be in clave or out of clave at any
        point.
      </p>
      <p>
        For salsa, there are four types of clave rhythms, the 3-2 and 2-3 Son
        claves being the most important, and the 3-2 and 2-3 Rumba claves. Most
        salsa music is played with one of the son claves, though a rumba clave
        is occasionally used, especially during rumba sections of some songs. As
        an example of how a clave fits within the 8 beats of a salsa dance, the
        beats of the 2-3 Son clave are played on the counts of 2, 3, 5, the
        "and" of 6, and 8. There are other common rhythms found in salsa music:
        the chord beat, the tumbao, and the Montuno rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chord beat (often played on cowbell) emphasizes the odd-numbered
        counts of salsa: 1, 3, 5 and 7 while the tumbao rhythm (often played on
        congas) emphasizes the "off-beats" of the music: 2, 4, 6, and 8. Some
        dancers like to use the strong sound of the cowbell to stay on the Salsa
        rhythm. Alternatively, others use the conga rhythm to create a jazzier
        feel to their dance since strong "off-beats" are a jazz element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tumbao is the name of the rhythm that is typically played with the conga
        drums. It sounds like: "cu, cum.. pa... cu, cum... pa". Its most basic
        pattern is played on the beats 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8. Tumbao rhythm is
        helpful for learning to dance contra-tiempo ("On2"). The beats 2 and 6
        are emphasized when dancing On2, and the Tumbao rhythm heavily
        emphasizes those beats as well.
      </p>

        The Montuno rhythm is a rhythm that is often played with a piano. The
        Montuno rhythm loops over the 8 counts and is useful for finding the
        direction of the music. By listening to the same rhythm, that loops back
        to the beginning after eight counts, one can recognize which count is
        the first beat of the music.
      </p>

        The basic salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every
        four beats of music. The odd number of steps creates the inherent
        syncopation to the Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of
        music to loop back to a new sequence of steps. Different styles employ
        this syncopation differently. For "On1" dancers this rhythm is described
        as "quick, quick, quick, pause, quick, quick, quick, pause". For "On2"
        dancers this rhythm is "quick, quick, slow, quick, quick, slow". In all
        cases, only three steps are taken in each 4-beat measure (or 6 total
        over 8 beats).
