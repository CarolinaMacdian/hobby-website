        Salsa is one of the most popular Latin dances that is today practiced
        worldwide. Salsa dance emerged in the Central American country of Cuba
        during the late 19th and early years of the 20th century. This country's
        rich musical history enabled many Latin dances to thrive, grow, and
        morph into new forms, leading to modern Salsa dance and Salsa music by
        the 1920s. The contemporary Salsa as we know it evolved from several
        earlier Cuban dance forms, including Son, Son Montuno, Mamba, Cha Cha
        Cha, and was also enriched with Puerto Rican influences of dances Bomba
        and Plena. After the initial burst of popularity in Cuba and Puerto
        Rico, Salsa quickly spread across Latin America and the United States,
        becoming one of the most popular Latin dances.
