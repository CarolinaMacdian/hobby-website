        Salsa is a Latin dance, associated with the music genre of the same
        name, which was first popularized in the United States in the 1960s in
        New York City. Salsa is a mixture of Cuban dances, such as mambo,
        pachanga, and rumba, as well as American dances such as swing and tap.
